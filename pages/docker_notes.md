# Notes on Docker, Y'all
We're kicking things off here. Docker is a version control service. When you upload a [tool?, item?, anything?] that others may rely on to the [web?], it should be permanent. That version remains available even as you upgrade and change versions, so that the folks who rely on the original versions don't end up with a broken [tool?].

I'm making this up as I go, folks. Enjoy.
